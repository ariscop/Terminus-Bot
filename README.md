# About the Bot

Terminus-Bot is an IRC bot written in Ruby under the MIT license. Its purpose
is to completely avoid the problems of other bots.

The authors of the project are long-time IRC bot users and know how things can
go badly or be confusing. Hopefully, we can address all of the problems we
have encountered, as well as all of those everyone else tells us about.

* Ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0
* gems (mandatory)
    * eventmachine (*should be built with SSL support*)
    * psych (included psych has UTF-8 bugs)
* gems (for some scripts)
    * htmlentities
    * multi_json
    * psych 1.2.2
    * dnsruby (dns script)
    * em-http-request (http_client module and all scripts that use it)

    * ruby-mpd (mpd script)
* Script Dependencies
    * netutils: ping, ping6, mtr

# How to use Terminus-Bot

## Installation and Configuration

See `doc/GettingStarted.md`.

After that, if you are interested in running Terminus-Bot in a Docker
container, see `doc/Dockerizing.md`.

## Code Documentation and Guides

Documentation is tentatively hosted at
[http://equine.vacantminded.com/terminus-bot/](http://equine.vacantminded.com/terminus-bot/).
This URL will change to something more appropriate very shortly, but we wanted
to get this out there now. Note that this is also where documentation changes
first appear, so you may encounter unfinished pages or unusual formatting.

## Scripts

This is a complete list of all official scripts that are distributed with the
bot. Commands provided by each script are listed here. For more complete
information on what a command does and how to use it, you should view the
on-IRC help for the command by using the [help script's](#help) HELP command.

In these examples, the command prefix used is @. When using the bot, be sure to
use whichever command prefix you set in the core configuration block.

### Account

Create and log in to bot accounts. This script is required if you want access to
administrative functions.

Commands:

* IDENTIFY - Log in to the bot.
* REGISTER - Register a new account on the bot.
* PASSWORD - Change your bot account password.
* FPASSWORD - Change another user's bot account password.
* LEVEL - Change a user's account level.
* ACCOUNT - Display information about a user.
* WHOAMI - Display your current user information if you are logged in.

### Admin

Manage the bot's core functionality.

Commands:

* RELOAD - Reload one or more scripts.
* UNLOAD - Unload one or more scripts.
* LOAD - Load the specified script.
* REHASH - Reload the configuration file.
* NICK - Change the bot's nick for the current connection.
* QUIT - Kill the bot.
* RECONNECT - Reconnect the specified connection.

### Away

Announce away status in channel when users are highlighted. This is pretty
annoying, but some archaic IRC clients don't know how to mark away users in the
nick list, so this _can_ be useful.

Commands:

* AWAY - Enable or disable away status announcements for the current channel.

### Backspace

React to `^H`, `^W`, `^U`, and `^Y` by displaying the resulting text.

* `^H` - Backspace
* `^W` - Delete last word
* `^U` - Delete line
* `^Y` - Paste buffer (from `^W` or `^U`)

### Base

Convert a number from one numeric base to another.

Commands:

* BASE - Convert a number from the specified base to another specified base.
* HEX - Convert a number between decimal and hexadecimal.

### Battle

Facilitate PRNG-based role-play battle games. No turn-based enforcement is done,
so it is up to the users how to use this. Once a battle is started, interaction
is done with IRC actions (/me). For example:

    <@Kabaka> @battle start
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka has started a battle!
    <Terminus-Bot> To attack other players, use /me attacks TARGET with ITEM
    <Terminus-Bot> You may check the health of active players by using the HEALTH command.
    * Kabaka attacks aji with Hammer of Thor
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka's Hammer of Thor hits aji for 12 damage.
    <Terminus-Bot> aji has 88 health remaining.
    * aji attacks Kabaka with pointy sticks
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka absorbs the hit and gains 20 health!
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka has 120 health remaining.

Starting health, the amount of damage that is possible, and the chance of hits
being ineffective is all configurable in terminus-bot.conf. Any players in the
channel may join in at any time. In large channels, this can get incredibly
hectic, so it is strongly recommended that this script only be used in smaller
channels.

Commands:

* BATTLE - Start, stop, or reset the battle in the current channel.
* HEALTH - View the health of all active players in this channel.
* HEAL - Heal players to maximum health.

### Chanlog

Log channel activity to disk. To disable logging for a specific channel, use the
bot's script flags to disable the script in those channels. Logs are written to
`var/terminus-bot/chanlog/` with the file name format `server.channel.log`.

This script is still experimental and will be subject to extensive changes before beta.

### Channels

Join and part channels, and maintain the list of channels the bot tries to
occupy. Without this script loaded, the bot will not attempt to join any 
channels and will not rejoin channels the next time it starts.

Commands:

* JOIN - Join a channel with optional key.
* PART - Part a channel
* CYCLE - Part and then join a channel.
* JOINCHANS - Force the join channels event.

### Choose

Lets the bot make decisions for you. There are two types of questions you may
ask the bot: Yes/no questions and questions with multiple answers.

To ask a question, begin your message with the bot's commmand prefix followed
by a space. For example:

    <Kabaka> @ Should I go to bed?
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka: No

    <Kabaka> @ Ruby, Python, or C?
    <Terminus-Bot> Kabaka: Ruby

### Cipher

* ENCODE - Encode some text using a particular cipher and key.
* DECODE - Decode some text using a particular cipher and key.
* CIPHERS - List the available ciphers.

### Flags

Manage the bot's script flags table.

This script is experimental and will be subject to change before beta.

Terminus-Bot allows you to enable or disable scripts per-channel. This is done
using script "flags." Flags can be on or off for any script in any channel on
any server.

When accessing or modifying the flags table, wildcards are supported.

    <Kabaka> @disable freenode * *

StaticBox:

    <Kabaka> @flags freenode #Terminus-Bot *

## Modules

Modules are files that augment the bot's core code. They cannot be unloaded or
reloaded. Some are required by some scripts.

### buffer

A short-term, in-memory message history. This is used by the regex script for
quick searching of recent messages for subtitution, and can easily be used by
other scripts.

### caps

Client capability negotiation. With this module loaded, the bot can use modern
IRC features such as multi-prefix and SASL to help improve security and reduce
bandwidth usage. Loading this module is strongly recommended.

### http_client

Simplifies HTTP access for scripts. This module handles redirects, timeouts, and
headers.

### ignores

Allows the bot to ignore other users. This is managed by the
[ignore script](#ignore).

### regex_handler

Provides an easy-to-use way for scripts to act on messages matching regular
expressions.

For usage examples, see the Reddit script and others.

### url_handler

Provides an easy-to-use way for scripts to react to URLs the bot sees in chat.

For usage examples, see the title script, Wikipedia script, and others.

## First Run

After you've completed configuration of the bot, type `./terminus-bot` in the
bot's directory. The bot will load all files and then disappear into the
background. It should then connect to IRC.

Since it won't join any channels until you tell it to, you'll have to manually
open a query with it by typing `/query Terminus-Bot` (replacing "Terminus-Bot"
with whatever nick you gave the bot).

From here, you'll need to register an account with the bot. When writing the
configuration file, you should have specified at least one level 10 account in
the admins block. Use that account name to register your new account using the
`register` command in the account script.

The bot should inform you that you've been logged in. Go ahead and have it join
a channel using the channel script's `join` command.

Remember, you can use the help script's `help` command to get a list of commands
and help with specific commands.

## Reporting Problems

Remember, Terminus-Bot is not yet done, so some things may not work correctly.
If you get stuck, or if something just isn't working, make sure you read the
relevant help and make sure you are not making a mistake. Once you're sure
there is a problem with your Terminus-Bot, head to the IRC channel at the top
of this document and ask one of the channel operators what to do. If there is
a bug, we'll probably need you to reproduce it with debug logging enabled so
that we can get a backtrace.
